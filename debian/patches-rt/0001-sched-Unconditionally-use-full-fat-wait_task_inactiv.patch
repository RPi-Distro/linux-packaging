Subject: [PATCH 1/2] sched: Unconditionally use full-fat wait_task_inactive()
Origin: https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/6.4/older/patches-6.4-rt6.tar.xz

While modifying wait_task_inactive() for PREEMPT_RT; the build robot
noted that UP got broken. This led to audit and consideration of the
UP implementation of wait_task_inactive().

It looks like the UP implementation is also broken for PREEMPT;
consider task_current_syscall() getting preempted between the two
calls to wait_task_inactive().

Therefore move the wait_task_inactive() implementation out of
CONFIG_SMP and unconditionally use it.
