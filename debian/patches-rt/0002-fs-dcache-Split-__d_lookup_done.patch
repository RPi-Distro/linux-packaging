Subject: [PATCH 2/4] fs/dcache: Split __d_lookup_done()
Origin: https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/5.19/older/patches-5.19-rc3-rt5.tar.xz

__d_lookup_done() wakes waiters on dentry::d_wait inside a preemption
disabled region. This violates the PREEMPT_RT constraints as the wake up
acquires wait_queue_head::lock which is a "sleeping" spinlock on RT.

As a first step to solve this, move the wake up outside of the
hlist_bl_lock() held section.

This is safe because:

  1) The whole sequence including the wake up is protected by dentry::lock.

  2) The waitqueue head is allocated by the caller on stack and can't go
     away until the whole callchain completes.

  3) If a queued waiter is woken by a spurious wake up, then it is blocked
     on dentry:lock before it can observe DCACHE_PAR_LOOKUP cleared and
     return from d_wait_lookup().

     As the wake up is inside the dentry:lock held region it's guaranteed
     that the waiters waitq is dequeued from the waitqueue head before the
     waiter returns.

     Moving the wake up past the unlock of dentry::lock would allow the
     waiter to return with the on stack waitq still enqueued due to a
     spurious wake up.

  4) New waiters have to acquire dentry::lock before checking whether the
     DCACHE_PAR_LOOKUP flag is set.

Let __d_lookup_unhash():

  1) Lock the lookup hash and clear DCACHE_PAR_LOOKUP
  2) Unhash the dentry
  3) Retrieve and clear dentry::d_wait
  4) Unlock the hash and return the retrieved waitqueue head pointer
  5) Let the caller handle the wake up.

This does not yet solve the PREEMPT_RT problem completely because
preemption is still disabled due to i_dir_seq being held for write. This
will be addressed in subsequent steps.

An alternative solution would be to switch the waitqueue to a simple
waitqueue, but aside of Linus not being a fan of them, moving the wake up
closer to the place where dentry::lock is unlocked reduces lock contention
time for the woken up waiter.
