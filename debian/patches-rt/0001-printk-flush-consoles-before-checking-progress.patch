Subject: [PATCH 001/108] printk: flush consoles before checking progress
Origin: https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/6.6/older/patches-6.6-rt12.tar.xz

Commit 9e70a5e109a4 ("printk: Add per-console suspended state")
removed console lock usage during resume and replaced it with
the clearly defined console_list_lock and srcu mechanisms.

However, the console lock usage had an important side-effect
of flushing the consoles. After its removal, consoles were no
longer flushed before checking their progress.

Add the console_lock/console_unlock dance to the beginning
of __pr_flush() to actually flush the consoles before checking
their progress. Also add comments to clarify this additional
usage of the console lock.

Finally, in case pr_flush() needs to poll-wait (for example,
because there has been a handover to another CPU), reduce the
polling interval from 100ms to 1ms. In the bug report it was
mentioned that 100ms is unnecessarily long.
