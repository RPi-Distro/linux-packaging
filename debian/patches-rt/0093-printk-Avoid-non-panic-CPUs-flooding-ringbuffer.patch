Subject: [PATCH 093/122] printk: Avoid non-panic CPUs flooding ringbuffer
Origin: https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/6.6/older/patches-6.6-rt15.tar.xz

Commit 13fb0f74d702 ("printk: Avoid livelock with heavy printk
during panic") introduced a mechanism to silence non-panic CPUs
if too many messages are being dropped. Aside from trying to
workaround the livelock bugs of legacy consoles, it was also
intended to avoid losing panic messages. However, if non-panic
CPUs are flooding the ringbuffer, then reacting to dropped
messages is too late.

To avoid losing panic CPU messages, the tracking needs to occur
when non-panic CPUs are storing messages. If non-panic CPUs have
filled approximately 1/4 the ringbuffer, they need to be
silenced to ensure the ringbuffer has ample space available for
the panic CPU messages.

Rather than trying to come up with an accurate heuristic to
measure the size used by non-panic CPUs, simply restrict them
to 1/4 the possible ringbuffer descriptors. In practice this
will end up being around 1/3 the ringbuffer size, which still
leaves ample space for the panic CPU messages.
