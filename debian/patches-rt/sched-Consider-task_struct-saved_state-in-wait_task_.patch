Subject: [PATCH] sched: Consider task_struct::saved_state in
 wait_task_inactive().
Origin: https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/5.19/older/patches-5.19-rc3-rt5.tar.xz

Ptrace is using wait_task_inactive() to wait for the tracee to reach a
certain task state. On PREEMPT_RT that state may be stored in
task_struct::saved_state while the tracee blocks on a sleeping lock and
task_struct::__state is set to TASK_RTLOCK_WAIT.
It is not possible to check only for TASK_RTLOCK_WAIT to be sure that the task
is blocked on a sleeping lock because during wake up (after the sleeping lock
has been acquired) the task state is set TASK_RUNNING. After the task in on CPU
and acquired the pi_lock it will reset the state accordingly but until then
TASK_RUNNING will be observed (with the desired state saved in saved_state).

Check also for task_struct::saved_state if the desired match was not found in
task_struct::__state on PREEMPT_RT. If the state was found in saved_state, wait
until the task is idle and state is visible in task_struct::__state.
